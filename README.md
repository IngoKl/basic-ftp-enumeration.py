# basic-ftp-enumeration.py
A simple FTP enumeration script written in Python 3.

## Installation

There's a very simple `install.sh` included which will create a symlink to `/usr/bin/basic-ftp-enumeration.py`

## Usage

`basic-ftp-enumeration.py IP [username] [password]`

This basic script is also used in one of my [custom AutoRecon plugins](https://github.com/IngoKl/custom_autorecon_plugins).
